<h1>Coding the AI</h1>

<p>
the hard AI was a part of the game that was NOT written by me, as im not a good player of Risk<br>
the hard AI in the game is very crap right now, so if you make something better, then u can replace it.<br>
<br>
<br>

The AI methods are called when the play(Risk risk) method in AIPlayer.java is called, it then calls the appropriate method from the appropriate class.<br>
<br>
the defualt methods are the ones used in AIEasy, but some of these methods are overridden in AIHard. in turn some of the AIHard methods are overridden in AIHardCapital and AIHardMission.<br>
<br>
each of these methods produces a String which is passed back to the game.<br>




<br>
(a list of constants can be found in RiskGame.java, as in a lot of places the number is used instead of the constant)<br>
<br>
there is also a idea to maybe have a AI that learns and gets better as you play it<br>
<br>
send me if u get anything to work better (<a href="&#0109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#121;u&#114;&#097;&#064;&#121;&#117;&#0114;&#097;&#046;&#0110;&#101;&#0116;">&#121;u&#114;&#097;&#064;&#0121;&#0117;&#0114;&#97;&#046;&#0110;&#101;&#0116;</a>)<br>
