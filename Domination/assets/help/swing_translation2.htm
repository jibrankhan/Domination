<h2>Manual way of editing the properties files</h2>

<p>As Risk comes by default in English language only, it may be hard to
    understand by non-english speaking people.</p><p>However, it's an open source project and you are very welcome to
    translate it into your mother tongue - or any other language you speak (or
    write) well. This helps non-english people to have a better game
    experience and thus a better time playing Risk.</p><p>Translation is very easy: You just have to translate a simple text
    file of the following form:</p><pre class="programlisting">...
mainmenu.newgame=New Game
mainmenu.startserver=Start Server
...</pre><p>the translated german version would look like</p><pre class="programlisting">...
mainmenu.newgame=Neues Spiel
mainmenu.startserver=Server starten
...</pre><p>Easy, isn't it?</p><p>To translate Risk into your language, just get the sources and make
    a copy of the file <tt class="filename">translation/Risk.properties</tt> and
    rename it to <tt class="filename">Risk_&lt;language code&gt;.properties</tt>
    (Replace <tt class="filename">&lt;language code&gt;</tt> with the 2-digit code
    of your language, e.g. "en" for english, "de" for german or "fr" for
    french).</p><p>Now just open the new <tt class="filename">Risk_xx.properties</tt> file
    in your favorite text editor and translate the strings in there.</p><p>Additional to the <tt class="filename">Risk.properties</tt> there is a
    file called <tt class="filename">DefaultMaps.properties</tt> which contains the
    translation of continent and country names, which can be translated as
    well.</p>

<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id4773309"></a>Translating maps</h3></div></div></div><p>Standard maps (whole world) are translated via the
      <tt class="filename">DefaultMaps.properties</tt> file. It it possible to
      translate single maps without using the DefaultMaps file.</p><p>Just create a new file in the <tt class="filename">maps/</tt> folder,
      called <tt class="filename">&lt;map name&gt;_&lt;language
      code&gt;.properties</tt>. For example, the german translation file
      for the <tt class="filename">simple.map</tt> map file would be called
      <tt class="filename">simple_de.properties</tt>.</p></div>
